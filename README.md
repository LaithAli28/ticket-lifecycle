<p>
Ticket Intake: The end user would first access the organization's ticketing platform, and create/submit their own tickets. Thus, instead of searching for issue points in a given workspace, they can come to you for help.

<p>
Ticket Properites consist of status, priority, department, Service Level Agreement (SLA), and the ticket's assigned agent.

Working Tickets and Communication. This ticket was assigned to both the Online Banking team and myself. I responded with an update to the issue after some research, and let the end user know we are actively working on a solution via the comment section. Being polite and empathetic with customers through good communication skills is CRUCIAL.

</p>
<p>
Resolution of Tickets. After a ticket has been worked to completion, you would edit the status of the ticket to resolved and notify the end user. Previously resolved tickets will remain accessible to view for future reference under the closed tab. You have now worked tickets for the first time!
